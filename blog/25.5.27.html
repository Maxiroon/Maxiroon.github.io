        <p>On May 27, 2021, I posted my very first video to YouTube. Four years later, I've posted over 900
            videos, recieved a total of about 8.5m views, gained over 21 thousand subscribers, and had an awesome time while
            doing it! I can not thank you all enough for the kind support over the years, whether it be donating, helping me with
            my content, or even just watching my videos. It's an honour to be able to entertain you and share my music with you all.

        <h1>Update on Community Picked Island 5</h1><br>
        <p>In November last year, I sent the Google Form for Community Picked Island number 5, where you could vote for
            the
            features of a quad island. It's been over six months, and I am so sorry about that wait! We're working on
            the
            final bits of that island, and I hope we can get it out as soon as we can. TO make up for it, here are the
            results of the poll!<br>
            Natural Triple - Repatillo <br>
            Doubles - Tuba, Clarinet, Agogo<br>
            Triples - Kora, Horn, Kitchen Supplies <br>
            Quad - Synth <br>
            Yes Wubbox <br>
            Yes Official Mythical <br>
            Yes Dipsters <br>
        </p>
        <p>In the future I would love to avoid these long waits between these islands, so going forward CPI6/7, as well
            as CPI8/9
            will be combined into one poll. This allows for both islands to be worked on at the same time and hopefully
            reduce
            the wait time. Like before, Cpi 6 will introduce a new element, and cpi 7 will give them a quad island. And
            as for why
            the quad islands were renamed to not include 'island'? I'm sure you'll find out in due time.<br>Here's a
            preview for CPPI5!</p>

        <h1>Ko-fi</h1>
        <p>Before I move on to the final announcement, I have some news regarding my channel membership. I'm removing
            it. For like the 5th time.
            I'm doing this because I'm replacing it with Ko-fi. I would appreciate it very much if you considered
            support me, as it allows me to
            make better content for you to watch. I will do my best to give supporters special rewards, like your name
            shown in videos.</p>

        <img src="/media/4year/01_pp.png" style="width: 25%;">
        <p>During June, I'll be releasing a new island called Plasma Passage! This is the first in the series called
            Hypernaturals. This is an idea I have over half a year ago, and I'm so excited to finally be showing it off
            So, what are Hypernaturals? Hypernaturals are unstable monstesr hybrids with natural and ethereal elements.
            Along with them come Ethereal Essences. While they may look like the scrapped natural essences from Dawn of
            Fire, they have been infused with the ethereal elements due to the ethereals' impact on the mirror timeline.
            Ethereal Essences can be obtained by searching the island, similar to Crystals. Once you have this essence,
            you can combine it with natural eggs to infuse it with the etheral element and get a Hypernatural hybrid! I
            can't wait for you all to discover this island next month.</p>
