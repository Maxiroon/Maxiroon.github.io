        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>(So far away)</p>
        <p>(So far away)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lived alone in the wild with my family</p>
        <p>Great in my reality</p>
        <p>Had one sister, one brother</p>
        <p>One father, one mother</p>
        <p>Out parents cared for us</p>
        <p>No one made a fuss</p>
        <p>Except my brother</p>
        <p>But he was nuts</p>
        <br>
        <p>(So far away)</p>
        <p>They are so far away</p>
        <p>Out of reach, out of way</p>
        <p>But I had to stay</p>
        <p>Out of reach, out of way</p>
        <br>
        <p>My sister's name is Lilac</p>
        <p>Our love didn't lack</p>
        <p>But my brother Liam</p>
        <p>He was kinda coo-coo crazy</p>
        <p>I loved my parents, too</p>
        <p>They never withdrew</p>
        <p>Until that one fateful day</p>
        <br>
        <p>(Far Away, out away)</p>
        <p>But I had to stay</p>
        <p>Out of reach, out of way</p>
        <p>They are so far away</p>
        <p>Out of reach, out of way</p>
        <p>But I had to stay</p>
        <p>Out of reach, out of way</p>

        <p>One day, our parents weren't</p>
        <p>We looked everywhere</p>
        <p>Neither was my brother</p>
        <p>We came to discover</p>
        <p>I never got a chance to say goodbye</p>
        <p>I must go on! (Can I go on?)</p>
        <br>
        <p>(So far away)</p>
        <p>(So far away)</p>
        <p>(Don't look)</p>
        <p>(Back, don't look back, Don't look) They are so far away</p>
        <p>(Back, don't look back, Don't look) Out of reach out of</p>
        <p>(Back, Don't look back, Don't look) way</p>
        <p>(Back)</p>
