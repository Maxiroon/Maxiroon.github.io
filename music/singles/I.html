        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>(I am here)</p>
        <p>I am here, I am here, writing this confusing thing</p>
        <p>Is it a song or a melody</p>
        <p>Me and you, you and me</p>
        <p>Using our last two brain cells and our</p>
        <p>Dipping dots are very good</p>
        <p>Yes, but what does that have to do with this</p>
        <p>Running round, round and round</p>
        <p>Round and round and round and round and round</p>
        <p>Bloody hell, I just really wanna</p>
        <p>Funny you think this song is good</p>
        <p>Cause it's not, it's really bad</p>
        <p>It should be demoted from my band</p>
        <br>
        <p> It's a confusing time up in our world</p>
        <p>Problems with war, inflation, and drag show girls</p>
        <p>It's pretty fucked up if you think about it</p>
        <p>And I agree wholeheartedly</p>
        <p>But this ordeal has me so fucking confused</p>
        <br>
        <p> (I am here)</p>
        <p>I, I don't even know what's going on</p>
        <p>Is it me or is it them</p>
        <p>Will I be exterminated</p>
        <p>For letting myself be who I am</p>
        <p>Birds are cool</p>
        <p>Yes, but what's that got to do with</p>
        <p>Never mind, it's half past nine</p>
        <p>And my parents are fucking proud of me, proud of you</p>
        <p> And my dog's up in a tree</p>
        <p> Markiplier's on my screen</p>
        <p> And I can't stop dying of laughter</p>
        <p>Because he's playing some</p>
        <p>Hose him down, they are muddy</p>
        <p>And I think I found a bone</p>
        <p>Trombones are loud</p>
        <p>Why is he so freaking short</p>
        <p>My brother's one foot</p>
        <p>Talking about confusing things</p>
        <p>And I just have to say
        <p>Are you confused</p>
        <p>This feels like ADH-</p>
        <p>Deep inside of the mountain</p>
        <p>There lives some dead caveman and</p>
        <p>Oh my word, is that a ghost</p>
        <p> Sorry, I just got distracted</p>
        <p>My friend has gotten me hooked</p>
        <p>Like a fish on the band</p>
        <p>And I think I just saw a man</p>
        <p>Dirty dishes, break that shit</p>
        <p>And then let's throw a ball</p>
        <br>
        <p>Cause it's a confusing time up in our world</p>
        <p>Problems with war, inflation, and drag show girls</p>
        <p>It's pretty fucked up if you think about it</p>
        <p>And I agree wholeheartedly</p>
        <p>But this ordeal has me so fucking confused</p>
        <br></p>
        <p>So why not be confused together</p>
