       <h1>FOUR YEAR ANNIVERSARY!</h1>
       <br>
       <p>On May 27, 2021, I posted my very first video to YouTube. Today, four years later, I've posted over 900 videos,
        recieved a total of about 8.5m views, gained over 21 thousand subscribers, and had an awesome time while doing it!
        I can not thank you all enough for the kind support over the years, whether it be donating, helping me with my content,
        or even just watching my videos. It's an honour to be able to entertain you and share my music with you all. Scroll down
        to read about the stream (or watch it!)</p>

        <h1>Update on Community Picked Island 5</h1>
        <p>In November last year, I sent the Google Form for Community Picked Island number 5, where you could vote for the
            features of a quad island. It's been over six months, and I am so sorry about that wait! We're working on the
            final bits of that island, and I hope we can get it out as soon as we can. TO make up for it, here are the
            results of the poll!<br>
        Natural Triple - Repatillo <br>
        Doubles - Tuba, Clarinet, Agogo<br>
        Triples - Kora, Horn, Kitchen Supplies <br>
        Quad - Synth <br>
        Yes Wubbox <br>
        Yes Official Mythical <br>
        Yes Dipsters <br>
        </p>
        <p>In the future I would love to avoid these long waits between these islands, so going forward CPI6/7, as well as CPI8/9
             will be combined into one poll. This allows for both islands to be worked on at the same time and hopefully reduce
             the wait time. Like before, Cpi 6 will introduce a new element, and cpi 7 will give them a quad island. And as for why
             the quad islands were renamed to not include 'island'? I'm sure you'll find out in due time.<br>Here's a preview for CPPI5!</p>

        <h1>Ko-fi</h1>
        <p>Before I move on to the final announcement, I have some news regarding my channel membership. I'm removing it. For like the 5th time.
            I'm doing this because I'm replacing it with Ko-fi. I would appreciate it very much if you considered support me, as it allows me to
            make better content for you to watch. I will do my best to give supporters special rewards, like your name shown in videos.</p>

        <a><p>During June, I'll be releasing a new island called Plasma Passage! This is the first in the series called Hypernaturals.
        This is an idea I have over half a year ago, and I'm so excited to finally be showing it off So, what are Hypernaturals?
        Hypernaturals are unstable monstesr hybrids with natural and ethereal elements. Along with them come Ethereal Essences.
        While they may look like the scrapped natural essences from Dawn of Fire, they have been infused with the ethereal
        elements due to the ethereals' impact on the mirror timeline. Ethereal Essences can be obtained by searching the island,
        similar to Crystals. Once you have this essence, you can combine it with natural eggs to infuse it with the etheral element
        and get a Hypernatural hybrid! I can't wait for you all to discover this island next month.</p></a></div>
